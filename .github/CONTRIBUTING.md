# Contributing

Contributions are what helps products open up to the community surrounding it. It also brings an amazing place to learn, inspire, and build. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

When contributing, please discuss the changes you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method before making a change. Pull requests are always welcome as long as they are well-documented of what you're trying to achieve.

The instructions found in this contribution guide apply to any [newgent.org](https://newgent.org) products or services in which you may want to contribute to.

## Responsibility with security

We kindly ask that you be considerate of others who are using the software and not publicly disclose security issues without contacting us first by email.

If you contact us by email and we fail to respond to you within a week you are welcome to publicly disclose whatever issue you have found. We understand how frustrating it is when you find something big and no one will respond to you. This holds us to a standard of providing prompt attention to any issues that arise and keeping this community safe.

Please reach out directly to ``hello@newgent.org`` when reporting any security vulnerability with our products or services.

### Contact us

You can find us in a couple places online. First and foremost, we're active right here on Github. If you encounter a bug or other problems, send us an email at ``hello@newgent.org`` for us to take a look at it.

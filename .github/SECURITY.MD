# Security Policy

To respect the safety of our customers during potential vulnerabilities within one of our products, we ask you to kindly read through this security policy to understand how to report any security vulnerability you've discovered to us correctly.

## Disclaimer

The instructions found in this security policy apply to any [newgent.org](https://newgent.org) products or services in which you may discover security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reach out directly to ``hello@newgent.org`` when reporting any security vulnerability with our products or services.

We make every effort to respond as soon as possible, although it may take a day or two to sync internally and determine the severity of the report and its impact. Please, do not use a public-facing channel or GitHub issues to report sensitive security issues.

As part of the process, we will create a security advisory for the affected versions and disclose it publicly, usually two to four weeks after releasing a version that addresses it.
